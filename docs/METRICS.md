### NPS:
The Net Promoter Score data is collected when the user fills out the survey question when prompted. When the user creates their account, a counter is added that tracks the amount of logins. When the user accumulates a set number of logins a pop up will appear which will ask them “How likely are you to recommend PoliSEE to a friend or colleague?” That data along with their satisfaction score is documented and stored under the ratings collections in Firestore Database.
